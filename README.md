## Introduction

   ```
   cd trip-planner
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```

   ```

4. Set up your Google Maps API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory

     ```
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Features

- Support for multiple countries and regions
- Optimized route calculation using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm
- Interactive map display of your route
- Multiple transportation modes (driving, walking, bicycling, transit)

## How to Use

1. **Select your trip area:**
   - Choose a country from the dropdown list
   - Enter the region or state within the selected country
   - Specify the city for your trip

2. **Enter locations:**
   - Input up to 10 locations you want to visit
   - Each location should be a specific place (e.g., "Eiffel Tower" rather than just "Paris")

3. **Generate the map:**
   - Click the "Generate Map" button
   - Select your preferred mode of transport
   - Wait for the application to calculate the optimal route

4. **View your optimized route:**
   - The map will display with numbered markers for each location
   - Blue lines show the route between locations
   - Each leg of the journey includes estimated travel time and distance

5. **Adjust as needed:**
   - You can change the transport mode and regenerate the map if desired

## Exporting to Google Maps

To use your planned route on your mobile device:

1. Click the "Export to Google Maps" button
2. Click the "Open in Google Maps" link
3. In Google Maps, use the "Send to your phone" feature to access the route on your mobile device
4. On your phone, you can then save or share the route as needed

## Tips and Tricks

- For best results, enter specific place names rather than general areas
- If a location isn't recognized, try adding more details (e.g., "Louvre Museum, Paris" instead of just "Louvre")
- The order of input doesn't matter; the app will optimize the route automatically
- Consider your mode of transport when planning â€“ walking routes might be very different from driving routes!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure all location names are spelled correctly
- Check that you've selected the correct country and region
- Try refreshing the page and re-entering your locations
- If problems persist, try clearing your browser cache and cookies
